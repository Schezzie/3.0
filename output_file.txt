6.5 Claims Regarding Copyright Infringement.
ABH respects the intellectual property rights of others. If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe that any User content or other content on the Site infringes your copyright, you may submit a notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) by providing our Copyright Agent with the following information in writing (see 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3) for further detail):
A physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;
Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, and if multiple copyrighted works are to be covered by a single notification, a list of such works;
Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled. Please also provide information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material;
Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact you, such as your name, address, telephone number, and your email address;
A statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;
A statement, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the above notification is accurate and that you are, or are authorized to act on behalf of, the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
Please note that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements set forth above, your DMCA notification may not be effective. Our designated Copyright Agent to receive notifications of claimed infringement is:
Greenberg Traurig, LLP
ATTN: Joel Feldman

Your physical or electronic signature.
Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled.
A statement by you under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification.
Your name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal district court in Los Angeles, California, and that you will accept service of process from the person who filed the notice of copyright infringement or an agent of such person.
If we receive a valid counter-notification, we may reinstate the removed or disabled material in accordance with the DMCA.
This notification process does not limit ABH’s ability to exercise any other rights or pursue any other remedies it may have to address claims of infringement.
6.6 Account Termination.
It is our policy to terminate, in appropriate circumstances, the accounts or access of users who repeatedly infringe copyrights. We may, in appropriate circumstances, terminate your account for the Site and any or all affiliate websites if you are a repeat infringer.

Your notice of dispute must be individual to you and must include, as applicable, your name, your email address, and your residential address. The notice of dispute also must explain the facts of the dispute as you understand them and tell us what you want us to do to resolve the issue. The Parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute directly through consultation and good faith negotiations, and you agree that a notice of dispute containing all of the information required above, followed by at least 60 days of good faith negotiation, are preconditions to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. A notice of dispute will not be valid unless it contains all of the information required by this paragraph. If you commence an arbitration without having previously provided a valid and compliant notice of dispute, you and we agree that the applicable arbitration provider (or the arbitrator, if one has been appointed) must suspend the arbitration pending compliance with this paragraph. You and we authorize the arbitration provider or the arbitrator to decide summarily whether the party that commenced an arbitration complied with these notice requirements, relying solely on these  Terms and the notice of dispute provided (if any). All statutes of limitation shall be tolled while the Parties engage in the informal dispute resolution process required by this paragraph.
Agreement to Binding Arbitration
. In the unlikely event that we do not reach an agreed upon solution within sixty (60) days from the date the informal dispute resolution is pursued pursuant to the Initial Dispute Resolution section above, then unless an Exception applies as stated below, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy arising out of or in connection with or relating to the Services, the Privacy Policy, or these Terms, including but not limited to its formation, performance, breach or alleged breach thereof, and regardless of whether the dispute is based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, or tort (collectively, “Claims”), by binding arbitration.
The Parties acknowledge that these Terms evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. Any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Terms shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16). The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
Except in the event of a Mass Arbitration (as defined below), the Parties agree that all Claims shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered on a confidential basis by JAMS, in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures as modified by these Terms, but excluding any rules or procedures that permit arbitration on a class-wide basis (collectively, the “JAMS Rules”). The JAMS Rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at https://www.jamsadr.com/adr-rules-procedures.  The seat of the arbitration will be decided pursuant to the JAMS Rules. You or ABH may elect to appear at the arbitration in person or, if you and we both agree, to conduct it remotely online via appropriate videoconferencing technology, in lieu of appearing live.
Each party will have the right to use legal counsel in connection with arbitration at its own expense. The Parties shall select a single neutral arbitrator in accordance with the JAMS Rules. Except as expressly stated to the contrary below, the arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all arbitrability issues, as well as all issues or Claims arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of these Terms, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of these Terms is void or voidable. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be in writing and provide a statement of the essential findings and conclusions, shall be binding on the Parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. In any arbitration before JAMS, the Parties adopt and agree to implement the JAMS Optional Arbitration Appeal Procedure (as it exists on the effective date of these Terms) with respect to any final award in an arbitration arising out of or related to these Terms.
If you initiate arbitration, to the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds Two Hundred and Fifty U.S. Dollars ($250) and the claim is found to be non-frivolous and not in bad faith, we will pay the additional cost. If we are required to pay the additional cost of the filing fees, you should submit a request for payment of fees to JAMS along with your form for initiating the arbitration, and we will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to JAMS. We will also be responsible for paying all other arbitration costs arising in connection with the arbitration, other than costs incurred by you for legal counsel, travel and other out-of-pocket costs and expenses not constituting fees or amounts payable to JAMS. You will not be required to pay fees and costs incurred by us if you do not prevail in arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines that the claim was frivolous or brought in bad faith, in which case the arbitrator may award us our attorney’s fees, expert witness fees, arbitration fees and/or costs. We will also pay JAMS to reimburse you for any portion of the $250 filing fee that is more than what you would otherwise have to pay to file suit in a court of law.
Class Action and Class Arbitration Waiver
. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING DISPUTES AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION OR CLASS ARBITRATION, OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL. To the extent applicable law does not permit waiver of private attorney general claims, but permits them to be arbitrated, then such claims shall be resolved in arbitration. You and we each further agree to waive our respective right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. If there is a final determination that applicable law precludes enforcement of the waiver contained in this paragraph as to any claim, cause of action or requested remedy, then that claim, cause of action or requested remedy will be severed and may be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction, but the waiver contained in this paragraph shall be enforced in arbitration on an individual basis as to all other claims, causes of action or requested remedies to the fullest extent possible. In the event that a claim, cause of action or requested remedy is severed pursuant to this paragraph, then you and we agree that the claims, causes of action or requested remedies that are not subject to arbitration will be stayed until all arbitrable claims, causes of action and requested remedies are resolved by the arbitrator. If a court or arbitrator decides that any part of this Agreement to Binding Arbitration cannot be enforced as to a particular request for public injunctive relief, then that request for public injunctive relief (and only that request for public injunctive relief) must be brought in court and must be stayed pending arbitration of the arbitrable remedies.
Exceptions to Arbitration
. Notwithstanding the Parties’ agreement to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or federal court that only asserts claims for patent infringement or invalidity, copyright infringement, piracy, moral rights violations, trademark infringement, and/or trade secret misappropriation. Excluded claims are subject to the jurisdiction provisions in Section 13 below.
Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for any individual disputes or claims within the scope of that court's jurisdiction. If an arbitration is filed, before the arbitrator is formally appointed, either party can send written notice to the opposing party and the applicable arbitration provider that it wants the case decided by a small claims court, after which the arbitration provider may close the case.
Exception—Mass Arbitration Before NAM
. Notwithstanding the Parties’ decision to have arbitrations administered by JAMS, in the event 25 or more demands for arbitration are filed relating to the same or similar subject matter and sharing common issues of law or fact, and counsel for the Parties submitting the demands are the same or coordinated, you and we agree that the demands will constitute a “Mass Arbitration.” If a Mass Arbitration is commenced, you and we agree that it shall not be governed by the JAMS Rules or administered by JAMS. Instead, a Mass Arbitration shall be administered by National Arbitration & Mediation (“NAM”), a nationally recognized arbitration provider, and governed by the NAM rules in effect when the Mass Arbitration is filed as modified by these Terms, including the NAM Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules, but excluding any rules that permit arbitration on a class-wide basis (collectively, the “NAM Rules”). The NAM Rules are available at www.namadr.com or by calling 1-800-358-2550. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary above, you and we agree that if either party fails or refuses to commence the Mass Arbitration before NAM, you or we may seek an order from a court of competent jurisdiction compelling compliance with this agreement and compelling administration of the Mass Arbitration before NAM. Pending resolution of any such requests to a court, you and we agree that all arbitrations comprising the Mass Arbitration (and any obligation to pay arbitration fees) shall be stayed. You and we acknowledge that either party’s failure to comply with this paragraph would irreparably harm the other, and you and we agree that a court may issue an order staying the arbitrations (and any obligation to pay arbitration fees) until any disagreements over the provisions of this paragraph are resolved by the court.
30 Day Right to Opt-Out
. You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions above by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out by emailing us at info@anastasiabeverlyhills.com, and providing the following information: (i) your name, (ii) your email address; (iii) your mailing address; and (iv) a statement of your wish not to resolve disputes with ABH through arbitration.  The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of your first use of the Service following the effective date of these Terns; otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those sections. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, we also will not be bound by them.
Term for Cause of Action
. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Services or these Terms must be filed within two (2) years after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
To the extent that the arbitration provisions set forth above do not apply or if you have opted out of arbitration, you and we agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Los Angeles County, California, and you and we agree that any litigation shall be filed exclusively in state or federal courts located in Los Angeles County, California (except for small claims court actions which may be brought in the county where you reside). In the event of litigation not subject to these Terns to Binding Arbitration, you and we agree to waive, to the maximum extent permitted by law, any right to bring a class action or any right to a jury trial, except where a class action or jury trial waiver is not permissible under applicable law.
